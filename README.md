# SQL Udacity Nanodegree


## Part 1 - Introduction to SQL

- Execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access, aggregate and join data tables.
- Understand when and how to use subqueries, window functions as well as partitions to complete complex tasks.
- Clean data, optimize SQL queries and write select advanced JOINs to enhance analysis performance.
- Explain which cases to use particular SQL commands and apply query results to address business problems.

 #### Project 1: Deforestation Exploration
 
- Act as a Data Analyst for a non-profit organization on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.
- Prepare a report for the executive team to understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.
- Identifying the most concerning regions and countries experiencing severe drop in forest area to determine where to concentrate efforts to combat deforestation.
- Techniques used: Create View, Table; Boolean Operators; Aggregations, Window Functions, Joins, CASE Statements etc.

## Part 2 - Management of Relational & Non-Relational Databases

- Databases need to be structured properly to enable efficient and effective querying and analysis of data.
- Build normalized, consistent and performant relational data models.
- Use SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) to create the data schemas designed in Postgres and apply SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) to migrate data from a denormalized schema to a normalized one.
- Understand the tradeoffs between relational databases and their non-relational counterparts and justify which one is best for different scenarios.
- With a radical shift of paradigms, learn about MongoDB and Redis to get an understanding of the differences in behaviors and requirements for non-relational databases.

#### Project 2: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator

Build the supporting data structure for Udiddit (similar to Reddit),
a social media news aggregator site. Design a new,
normalized and performant database and migrate over the data from the previously poorly designed database.
